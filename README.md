# Introduction
`keyoverlay-rs` is a simple, web-based keyoverlay written in Rust (hence the `-rs`).

# What makes keyoverlay-rs better?
When using other keyoverlays, I struggled with their rendering transparency, sometimes there was a black box behind, others forced you to use chroma key.

`keyoverlay-rs` avoids all these limitations by being run **in your browser**. This technique allows for perfect transparency and endless customizability.

# What requirements do I need to start running keyoverlay-rs?
Due to the nature of rust, the only requirements needed are the [Visual C++ Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and a browser.
