# Introduction
`keyoverlay-rs` is a simple, web-based keyoverlay written in Rust (hence the `-rs`).

# What makes keyoverlay-rs better?
When using other keyoverlays, I struggled with their rendering transparency, sometimes there was a black box behind, others forced you to use chroma key.

`keyoverlay-rs` avoids all these limitations by being run **in your browser**. This technique allows for perfect transparency and endless customizability.
